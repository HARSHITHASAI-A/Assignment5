 # VectaCorp page Design using Gulp and Sass
    
   #### There are two folders 
   * dist 
   > It is a distribution that contains css folder-> styles.css which includes styles for **index.html** page and images required for the webpage.
   * src
   > contains the .scss files like the partials written and styles.sccc which imports the partials
   * gulpfile.js
   > contains the code required to compile sass script
    
   Use this command **npx gulp** by concurrently opening **_index.html_** from the **dist** folder

   * You will be able to notice that _npx gulp_ converts code from SCSS to CSS after compiling.
   * You will also be able to see the changes made in **.scss file** would be overridden in **.css file**.
